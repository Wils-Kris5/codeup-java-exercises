Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a feature of inheritance
it allows us to treat objects of different subclasses that have the same superclass
   as if they were of the superclass type. 
 polyMorphic argument = superclass
 you can declare any of the subclasses


 sidenote: packages are classes that do related things, its to organize code
